;;; `make check-site` -- the gate that proves the generated site cannot rot
;;; silently. Named tests/site-check.sps, NOT tests/test-site-check.sps: the
;;; Makefile's TESTS := $(wildcard tests/test-*.sps) must not pick this up,
;;; because this program asserts on the REAL site/index.md + docs/*.md, not
;;; on fixtures, and belongs on its own `make check-site` target instead of
;;; inside `make test`'s loop.
;;;
;;; NOT pure: imports (site render), which imports (cmark gfm) and so loads
;;; a shared object -- same boundary tests/test-site-render.sps documents.
;;;
;;; Run like the repo's other native suites/gates:
;;;   CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS=src:tests:.:build/scheme-libs SITE_REF=main \
;;;     chez --program tests/site-check.sps
;;; or simply `make check-site`.
;;;
;;; Asserts the four invariants of .plans/2026-08-22-docs-site-design.md §7
;;; directly on render-site's return value -- no filesystem write, no
;;; `build/site/` dependency:
;;;   1. nav completeness -- (site pages) names exactly docs/*.md on disk.
;;;   2. anchor resolution -- render-site left no dangling intra-site link.
;;;   3. no relative .md leak -- every serialized href/src either resolves
;;;      to .html, is a same-page #anchor, or is an absolute (http...) URL;
;;;      none is a relative link still ending in .md.
;;;   4. no <pre> reflow -- the serializer never reindents preformatted code.
;;;
;;; Each invariant `die`s with its own name on failure and a non-zero exit,
;;; per AGENTS.md ("Expect a value only success can produce"): a caller
;;; grepping this program's stderr for which invariant broke gets an answer,
;;; not a guess.
