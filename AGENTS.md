## Project guidelines

* Use the functional core / imperative shell pattern
* Follow the 12 Factor Apps philosophy
* Use TDD / test-driven development
* A test that passes whether the code is right or wrong is worse than no test.
  Every decision in a module gets a mutation that breaks it, and the owning
  specification must notice. Seed an output variable before asserting it is empty.

  **A test is not finished when it passes. It is finished when you have watched
  it fail.** Before calling any new assertion done: copy the code under test to a
  scratch location outside the repo, break the specific decision that assertion
  claims to guard, run the suite, and confirm that assertion fails *by name*.
  Then revert and confirm it passes again. State the evidence when you report.
  - The mutation must break the test *through the asserted property*. If it fails
    for some other reason — a side effect of the edit, a syntax or import error —
    it has proved nothing. Narrow the mutation until the failure is the one you
    predicted.
  - If no mutation can break the assertion, the assertion is empty. Rewrite it, or
    write down in the mutation log that the property is uncovered and why. Leaving
    it silently is the exact failure this rule exists to prevent.
  - Prefer comparing against an expected value over asserting truthiness. In Scheme
    almost everything is true, so `test-assert` is where empty tests hide — see the
    truthiness trap below.
* Project is specific to Chez Scheme and will be a Chez library.
* Project requires C ffi and handling C libraries *safely*
* Project should be portable across macos (darwin), linux, and windows
* Project should be portable across amd64 and arm64
* Plans live in `/.plans`, decision records in `/.plans/decisions`
* Add entries to `CHANGELOG.md` for each release

## Traps this repo has already hit

Each of these shipped a passing test or a working-looking build that was wrong.
None is obvious from reading the code.

* **`0` is truthy in Scheme, and `guard` returns the body's value when nothing
  raises.** So `(test-assert "…" (guard (e ((pred e) #t) (#t #f)) (accessor x)))`
  passes even when `accessor` never raises — freed pointer fields are zeroed, and
  `0` satisfies `test-assert`. Assert on *what was raised*, compared against an
  expected value, with a distinct sentinel for the no-raise case. Three tests
  guarding the liveness mechanism passed against code with that mechanism deleted.
* **Every `tests/test-*.sps` must end with its own `(exit …)`.** SRFI-64 does not set
  a process exit status, so a suite missing that line always reports success and
  `make test` stays green through real failures. Anything appended *after* it is
  dead code — a sabotage test added that way silently never runs.
* **`foreign-procedure` resolves its entry point when the expression is evaluated,
  not when the procedure is first called.** Every binding must be defined after
  `load-shared-object`, which is why the load is written as a definition placed
  ahead of them in `native.sls`. Getting this wrong fails at *import* time, not at
  first use, so the error points nowhere near the mistake.
* **Read cmark's semantics from `vendor/cmark-gfm/`, never from recall.** Ownership,
  NULL-versus-empty returns, and return-value meaning have each contradicted
  reasonable expectations here: see ADR-0005, and
  `cmark_parser_attach_syntax_extension`, which has a single unconditional
  `return 1` and cannot signal failure at all.
